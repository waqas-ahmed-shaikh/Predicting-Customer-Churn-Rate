# Predicting-Customer-Churn-Rate
The project aimed at helping the company to reduce their customer churn rate by analyzing the data provided by them. It was achieved by using supervised machine learning techniques
1. The data was first cleaned in order to proceed with analysis. The cleaning process included dropping unnecessary columns, converting required columns into categorical variables to proceed with classification, balancing the target variable in order to reduce the bias.
2. Splitting the data in order to proceed with machine learning algorithms
3. Utilized various machine learning algorithms such as K-Nearest Neighbors, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest and Neural Net.
4. Based on the accuracy and False Positive rates, random forest classifier was chosen as the benchmark algorithm.
5. Thus, by using this algorithms, the company can predict beforehand whether a customer will churn or not. If the customer is churning, then they can offer various services to them beforehand and prevent churning
